# ConnectX
This program produces a connect 4 game that allows the user to choose the number of players, player tokens, size of the board, # of tokens in a row needed to win, and a fast or memory efficient game. The game expects users to enter numbers when appropriate, such as when choosing column number.

To compile the program, use the "make" command. To run the program, use the "make run" command. To compile the Testing files, use the "make test" command. To run the test cases for GameBoard, use the "make TestGB" command. To run the test cases for GameBoardMem, use the "make TestGBmem" command. To remove the compiled files, use the "make clean" command.
